Time Series Analysis Part 1
- The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my capabilites of using the statistical programming language, R, for time series analysis.

- The data for this project comes from a .csv file from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) containing average airfares calculated
  from quarterly BTS surveys for U.S.domestic flights from 2004 to 2018 (inflation adjusted to 2018 dollars).
  
- Scenario: As an employee of a large airline (in 2018), I would like to forecast 2019 average annual airfare in order to inform the airline’s pricing strategy.

- The business question is: “What is a reasonable forecast of 2019 average U.S. domestic airfare given the patterns in past data?”
